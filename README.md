# dog-game

This is a treat-hunting, wasp-avoiding game inspired by my very own furry baby. The goal is to collect as many treats as possible all the while avoiding the wasps. 

Game developed using html, css, javascript. 

The user needs to move the dog around the garden using the arrows on the keyboard.
